# "What's Happening" Category Classification Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** The Top Senders analytics shows 1,149 + 1,013 + 633 = 2,795 emails from senders with "What's Happening" in their name, but when filtering by the "Whats happening" category in the Emails container, it shows **0 emails**.

**Root Cause:** The emails from senders like "'What's Happening' via Batch 2022-2023" are being classified into different categories by the ML model based on their **email content**, NOT based on the sender name. The system counts them in "Top Senders" (which groups by sender address) but they're classified as "Academic", "Other", or "Promotions" instead of "Whats happening".

## Solution Overview

The fix involves:
1. **Diagnosing** - Check what category these emails are actually classified as
2. **Creating/Updating** - Ensure "Whats happening" category exists with proper classification rules
3. **Reclassifying** - Reclassify all existing emails from these senders to "Whats happening"

## How to Fix (Method 1: API Endpoints - Recommended)

### Step 1: Diagnose the Issue

While your server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostic/whats-happening
```

Or use curl:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostic/whats-happening
```

**Important:** You need to be logged in and include your JWT token in the Authorization header.

The response will show:
- Total number of emails from "What's Happening" senders
- What categories they're currently classified as
- Whether the "Whats happening" category exists
- Sample emails for verification

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

To automatically fix the issue, make a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostic/fix-whats-happening
```

Or simply navigate to this URL in your browser while logged in (you'll need to use a REST client or the browser console):

```javascript
// In browser console while logged in:
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostic/fix-whats-happening', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('Fix result:', data))
```

This will:
1. Create or update the "Whats happening" category with proper sender patterns
2. Reclassify ALL emails from "What's Happening" senders to this category
3. Clear the analytics cache to refresh dashboard metrics

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** or click the "Refresh Data" button
2. Go to the **Emails** tab
3. Filter by **"Whats happening"** category
4. You should now see all 2,795+ emails!

## How to Fix (Method 2: Command Line Scripts)

If you prefer to run the fix from the command line, two scripts are available:

### Diagnostic Script
```bash
cd server
node diagnose-whats-happening.js
```

### Fix Script  
```bash
cd server
node fix-whats-happening-classification.js
```

**Note:** These scripts require direct database access. Make sure your MongoDB connection string is properly configured in `.env`.

## Understanding the Fix

The fix script does three things:

### 1. Category Configuration
Creates/updates the "Whats happening" category with:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Whats happening',
  description: 'University announcements, events, and campus happenings',
  classificationStrategy: 'enhanced-rule-based',
  patterns: {
    senderDomains: [
      'batch2022-2023@ug.sharda.ac.in',
      'ug.group@ug.sharda.ac.in'
    ],
    senderNames: [
      "What's Happening",
      'Whats Happening'
    ],
    keywords: [
      'happening',
      'announcement',
      'campus',
      'event',
      'notice',
      'circular'
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Email Reclassification
Updates all emails matching the pattern:
- **From:** Contains "What's Happening" (case-insensitive, flexible apostrophe)
- **New Category:** "Whats happening"
- **Confidence:** 95% (high confidence due to direct pattern match)

### 3. Analytics Cache Clear
Clears the analytics cache to ensure:
- Dashboard metrics update immediately
- Category counts reflect the changes
- Top Senders and category filters are now in sync

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened

The email classification system uses ML models that analyze email **content** (subject, body, metadata) to determine categories. Sender information is only one of many factors. For university announcement emails:

- **Subject:** Often contains course names, event details, etc.
- **Content:** May mention placements, academics, promotions
- **ML Decision:** Classifies based on content, not sender name

This is why emails from "'What's Happening' via Batch 2022-2023" might be classified as:
- "Academic" (if mentioning courses/exams)
- "Placement" (if mentioning jobs/interviews)
- "Promotions" (if mentioning events/offers)
- "Other" (if no clear pattern match)

### The Solution Approach

The fix uses **rule-based classification** for these specific senders, which:
1. Takes precedence over ML-based content analysis
2. Ensures consistent categorization based on sender patterns
3. Maintains high confidence scores (95%) for reliable filtering

### Future Improvements

To prevent this issue with other sender patterns:

1. **Add sender pattern matching** to the classification pipeline
2. **Prioritize sender-based rules** before content-based ML
3. **Create category templates** for common sender patterns
4. **Monitor category drift** to detect similar issues automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Category exists but emails still show 0"

**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Click "Refresh Data" button in dashboard
- Check if category name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Issue: "Fix endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized"

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Include valid JWT token in Authorization header
- Token format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

### Issue: "Emails still in wrong category after fix"

**Solution:**
- Run the diagnostic endpoint to verify fix was applied
- Check server logs for any error messages
- Try running the fix endpoint again
- Manually trigger reclassification: `/api/emails/reclassify-all`

### Issue: "Command line scripts fail to connect to database"

**Solution:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running (check Docker containers)
- Verify MONGO_URI in `.env` file
- Check network connectivity
- Try using the API endpoint method instead
