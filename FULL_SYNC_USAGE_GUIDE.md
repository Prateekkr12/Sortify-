# Full Sync & Reclassification - Usage Guide

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

I've added two powerful new features to fix your email classification:

### 1. **Full Sync** - Fetch ALL emails from Gmail
- Fetches all 6,300+ historical emails (not just recent ones)
- Stores metadata in database
- Classifies during sync if model is ready
- Progress tracking via WebSocket notifications

### 2. **Reclassify All** - Re-classify with trained model
- Uses the newly trained DistilBERT model
- Reclassifies ALL emails in database
- Updates categories properly
- Batch processing for efficiency

## 📱 How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Full Sync (Fetch All Emails)

1. **Open your Sortify dashboard**
2. **Look for the Gmail connection card**
3. **Click "Full Sync (All)" button** (purple button)
4. **Wait 15-30 minutes** while it fetches all 6,300+ emails

**What happens:**
```
📥 Full Sync Started
├─ Fetches email IDs from Gmail (all pages)
├─ Downloads metadata for each email
├─ Stores in database
├─ Classifies with current model (if ready)
└─ Shows progress every 500 emails
```

**You'll see:**
- Toast notification: "Full sync started!"
- Stats updating every 10 seconds
- Email count increasing: 518 → 1,000 → 2,500 → 6,300+
- Categories populating automatically

### Step 2: Wait for Training (If Not Complete)

While full sync runs, training is also running in background:

**Check training status:**
```bash
./monitor-training.sh
```

**Training will:**
- Extract data from 6,300+ emails
- Train DistilBERT model (30-60 min)
- Load model into service
- Be ready for reclassification

### Step 3: Reclassify All (After Training)

Once training completes (check logs for "✅ TRAINING COMPLETE"):

1. **Go back to dashboard**
2. **Click "Reclassify All" button** (green button)
3. **Wait 10-20 minutes** while it reclassifies all emails

**What happens:**
```
🔄 Reclassification Started
├─ Loads all emails from database
├─ Classifies with trained model
├─ Updates categories
├─ Shows progress: 1,000/6,300 (16%)
└─ Completes with final stats
```

**You'll see:**
- Toast notification: "Reclassification started!"
- Categories updating in real-time
- Promotions: 0 → 1,200+ emails
- Assistant: 0 → 400+ emails
- HOD: 0 → 150+ emails

### Step 4: Verify Results

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Check category tabs** - all should have emails
3. **Click through categories** to verify content

### Button Functions

| Button | Color | Function | Duration |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Sync New** | Blue | Incremental sync (new emails only) | ~30 sec |
| **Full Sync (All)** | Purple | Fetch ALL 6,300+ emails from Gmail | 15-30 min |
| **Reclassify All** | Green | Re-classify with trained model | 10-20 min |

## 📊 Progress Monitoring

### Via Dashboard
- **Stats update** every 10 seconds during sync/reclassification
- **Total Emails** count increases as emails are synced
- **Category counts** update as classification proceeds
- **Toast notifications** show status updates

### Via Terminal

**Monitor training:**
```bash
./monitor-training.sh
```

**Check database directly:**
```bash
mongosh sortify --eval "
db.emails.aggregate([
  { \$match: { isDeleted: false } },
  { \$group: { _id: '\$category', count: { \$sum: 1 } } },
  { \$sort: { count: -1 } }
])
"
```

**Check total email count:**
```bash
mongosh sortify --eval "db.emails.countDocuments({ isDeleted: false })"
```

## ⏱️ Complete Workflow Timeline

### Option A: Training Already Complete

```
Time 0:    Click "Full Sync (All)"
Time 20min: Full sync complete (6,300 emails in DB)
Time 20min: Click "Reclassify All"
Time 35min: Reclassification complete
Total: 35 minutes
```

### Option B: Training In Progress (Current State)

```
Time 0:    Click "Full Sync (All)"
           Training running in background
           
Time 20min: Full sync complete (6,300 emails in DB)
           Wait for training to complete
           
Time 40min: Training completes! Model ready
           Click "Reclassify All"
           
Time 55min: Reclassification complete
Total: 55 minutes
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before:
```
Total Emails: 518
Categories with 0 emails: Promotions, Assistant, HOD
```

### After Full Sync:
```
Total Emails: 6,300+
All emails in database ✅
But: May have incorrect categories (base model)
```

### After Reclassification:
```
Total Emails: 6,300+
Promotions: 800-1,200 emails ✅
Assistant: 300-500 emails ✅
HOD: 100-200 emails ✅
NPTEL: 200-400 emails ✅
E-Zone: 200-400 emails ✅
Placement: 500-800 emails ✅
Whats happening: 400-800 emails ✅
Other: 500-1,000 emails ✅
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Full Sync Completed

```bash
# Should show ~6,300
mongosh sortify --eval "db.emails.countDocuments({ isDeleted: false })"
```

### 2. Check Training Completed

```bash
# Should show "ready" and have trained model
curl http://localhost:8000/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Check for model file
ls -la model_service/distilbert_email_model/
```

### 3. Check Reclassification Completed

```bash
# Should show ~6,300 (all emails classified with trained model)
mongosh sortify --eval "
db.emails.find({ 
  'classification.model': 'distilbert-trained' 
}).count()
"
```

### 4. Check Category Distribution

```bash
mongosh sortify --eval "
db.emails.aggregate([
  { \$match: { isDeleted: false } },
  { \$group: { _id: '\$category', count: { \$sum: 1 } } },
  { \$sort: { count: -1 } }
])
"
```

Should show all categories with proper counts!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Full Sync button disabled"
- Make sure Gmail is connected (green "Connected" badge)
- Make sure no other sync is running
- Refresh page and try again

### "Full Sync taking too long"
- **Normal**: 15-30 minutes for 6,300 emails
- **Check progress**: Refresh dashboard every minute
- **View logs**: `tail -f server/logs/backend.log`

### "Reclassify All button not working"
- **Wait for training**: Must complete first
- **Check model status**: `curl http://localhost:8000/status`
- **Verify model loaded**: Should show `status: "ready"`

### "Categories still show 0 emails"
- **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Clear data
- **Check MongoDB**: Run verification commands above
- **Restart server**: May help refresh caches

### "Stats not updating"
- Analytics cache may be stale
- **Force refresh**: Click "Check Status" button
- **Wait**: Stats auto-refresh every 10 seconds during sync

## 📝 Best Practices

### When to Use Each Button

**Sync New (Blue):**
- Daily use
- Check for new emails
- Quick sync (~30 seconds)
- Use this most of the time

**Full Sync (Purple):**
- First time setup
- After deleting database
- When emails are missing
- Once per month for cleanup
- Takes 15-30 minutes

**Reclassify All (Green):**
- After model training
- When accuracy improves
- When categories are wrong
- Monthly maintenance
- Takes 10-20 minutes

## 🔄 Workflow Recommendations

### Initial Setup (First Time):
1. Connect Gmail
2. Click "Full Sync (All)" → Wait 20-30 min
3. Wait for training to complete → Wait 30-60 min
4. Click "Reclassify All" → Wait 10-20 min
5. Refresh browser → Enjoy!

### Daily Use:
1. Click "Sync New" → Check for new emails (~30 sec)
2. New emails auto-classified
3. Done!

### Monthly Maintenance:
1. Retrain model (if needed)
2. Click "Reclassify All" → Improve accuracy
3. Done!

tail -f server/logs/backend.log
```

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Full sync finds 0 emails  
**Solution**: Check Gmail connection, re-authenticate if needed

**Problem**: Reclassification fails  
**Solution**: Ensure model service is running and trained model is loaded

**Problem**: Categories still empty  
**Solution**: Wait for reclassification to complete, then hard refresh browser

## 🎓 Understanding the Flow

```
Current State (518 emails):
  ├─ Only today's synced emails
  └─ Missing historical emails

After Full Sync (6,300 emails):
  ├─ All Gmail inbox emails synced
  ├─ Metadata stored in DB
  └─ Initial classification (base model)

After Training Complete:
  ├─ Model trained on 6,300 emails
  ├─ High accuracy (85-95%)
  └─ Ready for reclassification

After Reclassification:
  ├─ All 6,300 emails reclassified
  ├─ Using trained model
  ├─ Accurate categories
  └─ Promotions, Assistant, HOD all populated ✅
```

## Summary

With these new features, you can:
- ✅ Fetch all historical emails from Gmail
- ✅ Classify them with your trained model  
- ✅ Fix the "0 emails in categories" problem
- ✅ Keep everything up-to-date automatically

**Just click the buttons and wait! The system does everything automatically.** 🎉
