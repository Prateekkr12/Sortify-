# Gmail Archive Functionality - Debug Guide

## What I've Implemented

I've added comprehensive logging and verification to diagnose and fix the Gmail archiving issue.

## Features Added

### 1. **Enhanced Archive Endpoint** (`PUT /api/emails/:id/archive`)
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging at every step
- ‚úÖ Checks current Gmail label state before modifying
- ‚úÖ Skips API call if email is already archived
- ‚úÖ Verifies the change by fetching email state again after modification
- ‚úÖ Automatic OAuth token refresh
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error reporting

### 2. **Enhanced Unarchive Endpoint** (`PUT /api/emails/:id/unarchive`)
- ‚úÖ Same features as archive endpoint
- ‚úÖ Adds INBOX label back to restore email

### 3. **Diagnostic Scripts**
- ‚úÖ `check-gmail-ids.js` - Verifies emails have Gmail IDs
- ‚úÖ `test-gmail-archive.js` - Tests Gmail API directly with an email ID

## Expected Server Logs

When you archive an email, you should see logs like this in your server console:

```
============================================================
üì¶ ARCHIVE REQUEST RECEIVED
   Email ID: 67460c05b5a1234567890abc
   User ID: 6745abc123def456789
============================================================

üìß Email found in database:
   Subject: Test Email Subject
   Provider: gmail
   Gmail ID: 18f1234567890abcd
   Current Labels: INBOX, UNREAD, IMPORTANT
   Currently Archived: false

üîÑ Attempting to archive email in Gmail...
   Gmail ID: 18f1234567890abcd
   ‚úì User has Gmail connected with access token
   üì• Checking current Gmail state...
   üìß Current labels: INBOX, UNREAD, IMPORTANT
   üì§ Calling Gmail API to remove INBOX label...
   ‚úÖ Gmail API modify response: { 
      id: '18f1234567890abcd', 
      labelIds: 'UNREAD, IMPORTANT', 
      inboxRemoved: true 
   }
   üîç Verifying change in Gmail...
   üìß Final labels after modification: UNREAD, IMPORTANT
   ‚úÖ VERIFIED: INBOX label successfully removed from Gmail
‚úÖ Gmail archive synced successfully for email: Test Email Subject

‚úÖ ARCHIVE OPERATION COMPLETE
   Local DB Updated: YES
   Gmail Synced: YES
============================================================
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Email has no Gmail ID
**Log you'll see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è SKIPPING Gmail sync:
   Reason: Email has no Gmail ID
   This email may have been created manually or synced incorrectly
```

**Solution:**
1. Disconnect Gmail in Sortify
2. Reconnect Gmail
3. Click "Sync Gmail" button
4. Check that new emails have Gmail IDs

### Issue 2: Email already archived in Gmail
**Log you'll see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Email does not have INBOX label - already archived in Gmail
   Skipping Gmail API call
```

**Solution:**
This is actually fine - the email is already archived. The Sortify UI will update correctly.

### Issue 3: OAuth token expired
**Log you'll see:**
```
‚ùå Gmail archive error:
   Message: invalid_grant
   Code: 401
```

**Solution:**
The new code automatically refreshes tokens. If this persists:
1. Disconnect Gmail
2. Reconnect Gmail (this gets fresh tokens)

### Issue 4: Missing Gmail permissions
**Log you'll see:**
```
‚ùå Gmail archive error:
   Message: Insufficient Permission
   Code: 403
```

**Solution:**
1. Disconnect Gmail
2. Reconnect Gmail
3. Make sure to grant all permissions when prompted

### Issue 5: Gmail API rate limit
**Log you'll see:**
```
‚ùå Gmail archive error:
   Message: Rate Limit Exceeded
   Code: 429
```

**Solution:**
Wait a few minutes and try again.

## How to Test

### Test 1: Check Email IDs
```bash
cd /Users/sachingupta/Desktop/Sortify-/server
node check-gmail-ids.js
```

This will show:
- Total emails in database
- How many have Gmail IDs
- Sample emails with their data

### Test 2: Archive an Email
1. Keep server terminal visible
2. Open Sortify in browser
3. Archive an email
4. Watch the detailed logs in server terminal
5. Check Gmail app to verify email was archived

### Test 3: Test Specific Email
```bash
cd /Users/sachingupta/Desktop/Sortify-/server
node test-gmail-archive.js <email-id>
```

Replace `<email-id>` with an actual email ID from your database (get it from Test 1).

## What Should Happen

When working correctly:

1. **In Sortify:**
   - Email gets gray "Archived" badge
   - Button changes to blue "Unarchive" button
   - Email stays visible in list

2. **In Gmail:**
   - Email disappears from Inbox
   - Email appears in "All Mail"
   - Email is marked as archived

3. **Server Logs:**
   - Shows detailed step-by-step process
   - Confirms Gmail API call success
   - Verifies INBOX label was removed

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Server is running (`npm run dev` in server directory)
- [ ] MongoDB is connected (check server startup logs)
- [ ] Gmail is connected in Sortify UI
- [ ] Emails have Gmail IDs (run check-gmail-ids.js)
- [ ] OAuth tokens are valid (reconnect if needed)
- [ ] Server console shows the detailed logs
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your server** to load the new code
2. **Archive an email** and watch the server logs
3. **Share the logs** with me if it still doesn't work

The comprehensive logging will tell us exactly what's happening!
