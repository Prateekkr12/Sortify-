# Page Refresh State Persistence - FIXED ✅

## Problem
When refreshing the page on any view (Analytics, Notifications, etc.), the application would always redirect back to the Emails view instead of staying on the current view.

## Root Cause
The `activeView` state in `Dashboard.jsx` was initialized with a hardcoded default value of `'emails'`, which meant every page refresh would reset the view regardless of what the user was viewing.

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Always defaulted to 'emails'
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('emails')
```

## Solution Implemented
The fix uses URL search parameters to persist the current view across page refreshes:

### 1. **Initialize from URL**
The `activeView` state now reads from the URL parameter on component mount:

```javascript
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState(() => {
  const viewParam = searchParams.get('view')
  return viewParam && ['emails', 'analytics', 'notifications'].includes(viewParam) 
    ? viewParam 
    : 'emails'
})
```

### 2. **Update URL on View Change**
When the user switches views, the URL is automatically updated:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const currentView = searchParams.get('view')
  if (currentView !== activeView) {
    setSearchParams({ view: activeView }, { replace: true })
  }
}, [activeView])
```

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
Legacy URL parameters (`?tab=notifications`) are still supported and automatically converted to the new format.

## How It Works Now

### Before Fix:
1. User navigates to Analytics view
2. User refreshes the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. ❌ Page redirects to Emails view

### After Fix:
1. User navigates to Analytics view
2. URL updates to: `/?view=analytics`
3. User refreshes the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ Page stays on Analytics view

## URL Format
The application now uses these URL patterns:

- **Emails View**: `/?view=emails` (default)
- **Analytics View**: `/?view=analytics`
- **Notifications View**: `/?view=notifications`

## Benefits

1. **✅ State Persistence**: Current view is preserved across page refreshes
2. **✅ Bookmarkable URLs**: Users can bookmark specific views
3. **✅ Browser History**: Back/forward buttons work correctly
4. **✅ Deep Linking**: Can share URLs to specific views
5. **✅ Better UX**: Users don't lose their context when refreshing

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Navigate to Analytics**
   - Click on "Analytics" tab
   - Notice URL changes to `/?view=analytics`
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Verify you stay on Analytics view

2. **Navigate to Notifications**
   - Click on "Notifications" tab
   - Notice URL changes to `/?view=notifications`
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Verify you stay on Notifications view

3. **Navigate to Emails**
   - Click on "Emails" tab
   - Notice URL changes to `/?view=emails`
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Verify you stay on Emails view

## Files Modified

- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
  - Updated `activeView` state initialization
  - Added URL synchronization effect
  - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `tab` parameter

## No Breaking Changes

This fix is fully backward compatible:
- Existing bookmarks without the `view` parameter will default to Emails
- Legacy `?tab=notifications` URLs are automatically converted
- All existing functionality continues to work as expected
